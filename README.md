## 📊 Dataset Sampling and Pre-processing

**1. Sampling Methodology**
Due to the substantial size of the full corpus, the datasets presented here act as a **representative subset**. We employed a **random sampling technique** to reduce data volume while maintaining the statistical properties of the original population. This approach ensures feasibility for computational processing without compromising the integrity of the data distribution.

**2. Longitudinal Data Imbalance (2017 vs. Later Years)**
The sample size for the 2017 dataset is notably smaller than that of 2019 and later years. This imbalance is **intrinsic to the data source** and correlates with the lower availability of digital job postings during that period. The sampling process respected these original proportions to accurately reflect the historical growth of the recruitment market.

**3. Data Readiness**
This dataset is currently in a **partially cleaned state**. Basic noise reduction has been applied, but the data is intended to serve as a baseline for subsequent stages of the pipeline, including advanced text mining, entity extraction, and industry classification.
